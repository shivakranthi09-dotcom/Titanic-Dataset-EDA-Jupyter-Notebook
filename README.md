#Titanic Dataset EDA – Jupyter Notebook (Kaggle Dataset)


This repository contains my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using a custom Jupyter Notebook file named EDA_Titanic.ipynb, created in VS Code. The project focuses on data cleaning, preprocessing, visualization, and understanding survival patterns.

Key Steps & Features

 -Loaded the train.csv dataset and explored structure using head(), info()
 -Identified and handled missing data

   -Replaced missing Age values with median
   -Filled Embarked missing values with mode

 -Checked categorical value counts (Sex, Embarked)
 -Created multiple visualisations:

   -Histogram – Age distribution
   -Box Plot – Outlier detection
   -Scatter Plot – Age vs Fare
   -Count Plot – Gender vs Survival
   -Bar Plot – Survival rate by Class

 Technologies Used

   -Python
   -Jupyter Notebook (VS Code)
   -Pandas, NumPy
   -Matplotlib, Seaborn
